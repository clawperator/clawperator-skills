# Skill Development Workflow

This page is the shortest path from "I explored an app manually" to "I have a
reusable skill with a repeatable validation loop."

Clawperator stays neutral in this process:

- the external agent decides what the workflow should do
- Clawperator provides deterministic UI actions and structured results
- the skill packages selectors, parsing, and app-specific behavior

## 1. Explore the UI first

Start with the generic runtime, not a skill.

For unknown apps, use the default observe-act-observe loop:

1. take a snapshot
2. decide on one action
3. execute one small step or one tight sequence
4. snapshot again
5. repeat until the path is understood

Useful commands:

```bash
clawperator observe snapshot --device-id <device_id> --output json
clawperator observe screenshot --device-id <device_id> --path /tmp/example.png --output json
clawperator execute --device-id <device_id> --execution /path/to/execution.json --output json
```

During exploration, record:

- stable `resourceId` selectors
- text labels that are stable enough to match
- whether the real control is hidden behind a decoy control
- overlays, permission dialogs, or OEM-specific variations
- realistic timeout needs for the slowest steps

## 2. Decide whether the skill should be a script or an artifact

Use a script when the workflow needs:

- branching logic
- snapshot parsing
- custom output formatting
- retries or fallback logic
- host-side work such as screenshot file management

Use an artifact when the workflow is mostly a deterministic execution template
with variable substitution.

Rule of thumb:

- artifact for stable "do these actions" flows
- script for "observe, decide, parse, and report" flows

## 3. Scaffold the skill

Use the scaffold command so the folder layout and registry entry start in a
known-good state:

```bash
clawperator skills new <skill_id>
```

This creates:

- a skill folder
- `SKILL.md`
- `skill.json`
- `scripts/run.js`
- a registry entry in the configured local skills registry

If the registry location is unclear, check:

```bash
echo "$CLAWPERATOR_SKILLS_REGISTRY"
```

## 4. Encode the flow

After scaffolding:

1. update `skill.json`
2. replace the starter script with the real workflow
3. add `artifacts/*.recipe.json` if deterministic compile-time templates help
4. document required inputs and outputs in `SKILL.md`

Keep the skill narrow. A skill should package one reusable intent, not a
general planner.

## 5. Run structural validation before touching a device

Use structural validation every time the skill layout or registry entry
changes:

```bash
clawperator skills validate <skill_id>
clawperator skills validate --all
```

What this proves:

- the registry entry exists
- `skill.json` matches the registry metadata
- `SKILL.md` exists
- listed scripts exist
- listed artifacts exist

What this does not prove:

- that the Android app is in the expected state
- that selectors still match live UI
- that script logic produces the intended output

## 6. Validate artifacts without a device

For artifact-backed skills, compile the artifact before any live run:

```bash
clawperator skills compile-artifact <skill_id> --artifact <name> --vars '{"KEY":"value"}' --output json
```

This catches:

- missing artifact files
- missing required template variables
- invalid `--vars` JSON
- execution payloads that fail Clawperator's execution validator

If you want to check the compiled payload again through the execution validator
without sending it to a device, use:

```bash
clawperator execute --validate-only --execution /path/to/compiled-execution.json --output json
```

This is the closest current workflow to a dry run for artifact-backed skills.

### Structural validation and live runs

Before running a skill on a device, validate the skill definition first:

```bash
clawperator skills validate <skill_id>
clawperator skills run <skill_id> --device-id <device_id>
```

`skills validate` keeps the normal integrity checks in place. It verifies that
the registry entry exists, the metadata matches, and the declared scripts and
artifacts are present on disk before any device interaction happens.

What it does not cover:

- runtime UI state
- selector reachability on a live device
- app-specific branching inside a skill script

Script-only skills are a special case: their payload is generated at runtime by
the skill script, so static payload validation is skipped and the command logs a
reason instead of failing.

There is no `--skip-validate` escape hatch in `clawperator skills run`. If you
need to experiment with a script directly, invoke the underlying script or
adjust the skill definition first, then re-run `clawperator skills validate`.

### Recording-derived skills

When a skill is authored from a human recording, do not replay the trace
literally. Normalize it into a stable replay sequence:

- map launcher entry taps to `open_app`
- add `close_app` only when the app is stateful and a clean baseline is needed
- keep the raw recording as evidence, but make the replay skill follow the
  stable app-level intent
- if a search screen stays open after `enter_text`, submit with a real IME
  enter key instead of assuming the text action will advance the app
- for long scrollable settings lists, settle briefly after the screen opens,
  then scroll to the target element instead of waiting for that element to
  already be visible
- use live snapshots to detect terminal states instead of long fixed sleeps
- stop immediately when the final screen is visible, even if the screen
  arrived faster than expected
- keep stdout for the final artifact and use stderr for small progress markers

If you need the raw recording contract before you normalize anything, start
with [Android Recording Format for Agents](../ai-agents/android-recording.md),
then return here to turn the trace into a skill.

Do not declare the skill complete until the replay covers every meaningful
recorded action or documents why a step was normalized away. A click that
opened a page in the recording, but is missing from the replay, is a bug - not
just a stylistic difference. The same is true for any action that was
replaced by `open_app`, `close_app`, IME submit, or a deliberate row click.

If the recording lands on a terminal result screen, the skill should finish as
soon as that screen is visible. Avoid fixed "sleep and hope" completion logic
unless the app offers no better signal.

## 7. Use a layered test loop

Treat skill verification as four distinct layers:

1. **Registry integrity**
   `clawperator skills validate <skill_id>`
2. **Artifact compile validity**
   `clawperator skills compile-artifact ...`
3. **Execution payload validity**
   `clawperator execute --validate-only ...`
4. **Live device behavior**
   `clawperator skills run <skill_id> --device-id <device_id> [--timeout-ms <n>]`

This keeps failures local:

- registry failure means metadata or paths are wrong
- compile failure means template variables or payload shape are wrong
- validate-only failure means the execution contract is wrong
- live-run failure usually means runtime state, selectors, timing, or parsing

For lightweight smoke checks on expected markers, add
`--expect-contains <text>` to the live run.

When wrapper flags or output behavior matter, check the shipped CLI help
instead of guessing from memory:

```bash
clawperator skills compile-artifact --help
clawperator skills run --help
```

## 8. Inspect partial output on script failures

When `clawperator skills run` fails or times out, do not assume the run
produced no useful information. The wrapper now preserves partial `stdout` and
`stderr` when available.

Agents should inspect those fields before retrying blindly. A timeout often
still contains:

- the last completed step
- a partial parse result
- enough context to distinguish a slow device from a selector failure

## 9. Promote from exploration to reusable automation

A workflow is ready to become a reusable skill when:

- the navigation path is understood
- the selector choices are intentional
- timeout budgets are documented
- expected output format is stable
- failure messages help the caller recover

At that point, update `SKILL.md` so another agent can understand:

- required inputs
- expected outputs
- known failure modes
- whether credentials, account state, or app setup are assumed

## 10. Recommended development checklist

For a new skill, this is the practical order:

1. explore with `observe snapshot`, `observe screenshot`, and small executions
2. scaffold with `clawperator skills new <skill_id>`
3. encode the skill script or artifact
4. run `clawperator skills validate <skill_id>`
5. if artifacts exist, run `clawperator skills compile-artifact ...`
6. run `clawperator execute --validate-only ...` on candidate payloads
7. run `clawperator skills validate <skill_id>`
8. run `clawperator skills run <skill_id> --device-id <device_id>`
9. harden selectors, timeout budgets, and output formatting
10. verify that every meaningful recorded action is covered or explicitly
   normalized
11. run `clawperator skills validate --all` before wider use
